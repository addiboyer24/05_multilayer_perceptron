What do we need to fit this model?  \n",

To collect such a dataset we could simply put out a camera (strapped to a tree, for example), set it to take pictures at random and determine whether there is a deer in the image (we could determine this by hand or using a machine learning algorithm to automatically process the image, something that we'll get to in this course!).  In full disclosure, the dataset that I'll provide here is synthetically generated (i.e. it's from a simulation).  However, let's suspend disbelief and imagine that we've done what we described above.

As such, the optimization procedure essentially throws up its hands and says \"the best I can do is to default to the prior distribution, which is about a 40% chance of success.

In particular, our capacity to use expert judgement to come up with a sensible function to use as a transformation mechanism becomes prohibitive as the dimensionality of the data becomes large.  Thus, we need to come up with an *automatic* method for transforming this data such that it is amenable for use in logistic (or softmax) regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.4 Graphical models\n",
    "Before we tackle the problem of automatic data transformation, it will be useful to write our models graphically, just to keep things straight.  We'll write square nodes for input features, and lines indicating multiplication, with the coefficient of that multiplication written above the line.  Circular nodes will represent a function that takes as input $a$, which is a sum of all the inputs going to that node, and outputs $z$.  With this notation we can easily write normal logistic regression as\n",

    "## 5.5 Hidden layers\n",
    "Each of these models are in fact (very simple) neural networks, where we map directly from input to prediction to cost function, by the way of these simple activation functions: the identity corresponds to values on the real line, the sigmoid to predicting binary classses, etc.  These activations act on fixed basis functions specified by the input: the ones column, the $x_1$ column, etc.  What if we decided to incorporate an intermediate layer that could somehow mix up the basis functions into alternative basis functions that we would then feed to our activation.  For example, what if instead of just feeding weighted combinations of features to the logistic function, we instead preprocessed those data into a different set of basis functions?  Perhaps we wouldn't be able to understand exactly what those basis functions were, but they would give our model more flexibility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce another set of activation functions that our inputs pass through before they reach the sigmoid.  This layer of nodes is referred to as a \\emph{hidden layer}.  In principle, we could have as many as we want.  These activation functions \\emph{must} be non-linear for this to be useful.  **What happens when we use the identity as an activation function in this intermediate layer?:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, using the logistic function itself is a popular choice, but there are many(!) other possibilities.  The primary use of this is that a linear combination of sigmoids is a *universal function approximator*, which is to say that if we take the linear combination of enough of these things, then we can approximate any function that we want to.  For example, what if we wanted to approximate a bell curve: we could use two sigmoids with opposite signs and different translations, which would add up to something approximating a bell curve.  What happens if we wanted to approximate a line?  This wouldn't work because there are these plateaus, right?  It still works, because we could just make one of our sigmoids highly diffuse, so that only this roughly linear interior section is in play, then simply ignore the second one by setting its output weight to zero.  Two sigmoids actually have the capacity to roughly mimic pretty much anything that is linear of unimodal:  pretty much anything with one peak or less.  If we increase the number of nodes in the hidden layer, then we can mimic even more functions, like a sinusoid: for our deer problem, we can use a bank of sigmoids to approximate the sinusoidal transformation we came up with heuristically above!  In particular, we'll use the following graph\n",
